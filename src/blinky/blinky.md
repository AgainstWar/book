> * This section should be an intro using (ideally) NO external crates on how to blink an LED in as few steps as possible
> * It should be a step by step guide that introduces parts of Rust tooling that are not common to desktop programs
> * It should also introduce the concept of using `unsafe` to manually dereference raw pointers to talk to a peripheral
