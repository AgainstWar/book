# Unlearning Bad Embedded Habits

I'm not sure about this section. I wanted to illustrate things that are considered "bad practice" in most places, but are widely used in Embedded still. Anything in this section should not focus on demeaning other techniques, but instead provide useful alternatives and recipes.

If we can't come up with a positive way to spin this, we should remove this section.

> **This section should cover:**
>
> * Global mutable state, including peripherals
> * Code reuse
> * Premature optimization
> * Raw pointer indexing
