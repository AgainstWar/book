# Embedded-HAL Traits

> **This section should cover:**
>
> * What are the embedded HAL traits used for?
> * Who writes them, and how?
> * How do they help us write more portable code?
> * What are some common traits?
> * A demo of our blinky demo using Embedded HAL traits
> * A demo of our application code, but running on an embedded linux GPIO impl instead?
> * Maybe a note on how even with this layer of abstraction, LLVM still "flattens" this code
> * Maybe a note that even if this isn't 100% most efficient in all cases, it is a good starting point until optimization is necessary
