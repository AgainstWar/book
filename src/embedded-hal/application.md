> **This section should cover:**
>
> * Writing a fancier application using all the stuff we've learned
> * Best practices for structuring a project
> * Integrating other crates, including
>     * more drivers
>     * `#[no_std]` crates (maybe `serde` or similar?)
> * Using `embedded-hal` traits for portability
> * Allocators?
> * More powerful parts of the `core` language? Iterators? Matching, etc?
