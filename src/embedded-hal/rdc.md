>
> * What is a Register Definition Crate?
> * SVDs and `svd2rust` - generating Register Definition Crates
> * You don't have to use `svd2rust`, but you probably want to
> * What is possible with just a register definition crate?
> * A slightly better blinky using the types defined by the RDC for the board we will use
> * Maybe mention "family" crates, for info shared between families of chips
