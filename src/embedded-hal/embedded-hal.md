# The Embedded-HAL Ecosystem

> **This section should cover:**
>
> * Explain the layers in the embedded-hal ecosystem
> * Slowly building from the ground up through the layers, showing examples of usage at each layer
> * Where each layer comes from (who writes it, and how)
> * Any concepts introduced at each layer
> * Link out to the embeddednomicon for how to write in more detail
